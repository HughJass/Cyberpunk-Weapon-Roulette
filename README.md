# Cyberpunk-Weapon-Roulette

A mod by Hugh Jass and tommyY
  
How to install:  
1. Make sure you have Cyberpunk Engine Tweaks updated for 1.12  
2. Download the mod zip file  
3. Extract the content in "<path>\Cyberpunk 2077\bin\x64\plugins\cyber_engine_tweaks\mods\"  
4. Start the game  
  
How to use:  
1. Under the settings tab you can change the following:  
   - Difficulty: A multiplier on the gun stats to lower its damage. Lower settings would reflect a higher difficulty.  
   - Timer: The number of seconds between randomized guns being assigned as the active weapon. Default is set to 30 seconds.  
   - Rarity: Specify the rarity to be forcefully applied to every gun that spawns. Random is a selectable and the default option.  
   - Gun Types: Specify the type of weapons to include in the pool (Power, Tech, Smart, Blunt, Blade). Default set to all weapon types.  
2. Click update. Without updating, all of the default settings will be applied on start.  
3. Under the stats page, click START and the mod will begin by assigning a first weapon.  
4. The randomizing process is only initiated while in combat, and the timer for when a new weapon will spawn is represented as a progress bar in the stats tab.  
  
Known issues:   
1. Attachments/Mods currently unavailable. Can't seem to work around the game crashing when trying to equip any mods with a function.  
2. Eventually would like to minimize the UI's visibility while active so it's less intrusive.  
3. The stats on the guns are hardcoded integers and scale with your level. Eventually we want it all to be customizable and also reflect actual stats from normally upgraded weapons of the relevant types (Example: Headshot multipliers never get that high on Shotguns, but the hardcoding forces it to take on values that you would typically see on Rifles).
